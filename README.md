# Laser Data Plotter

The Laser Data Plotter is a project for the Codeacademy.lt beginners course in Python programming. The program loads
data from a database file (.db) and plots a graph for a chosen parameter. The selected serial number is highlighted.
Additionally, some basic statistics are calculated: standard deviation, mean, minimum, and maximum values.

## Set Up

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install required packages.

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

Database file must be placed in the project folder.
